**Special Access Programs** (**SAPs**) in the U.S. Federal Government are security protocols that provide highly classified information with safeguards and access restrictions that exceed those for regular (collateral) classified information. SAPs can range from **black projects** to routine but especially-sensitive operations, such as COMSEC (communications security) maintenance or presidential transportation support. In addition to collateral controls, a SAP may impose more stringent investigative or adjudicative requirements, specialized non-disclosure agreements, special terminology or markings, exclusion from standard contract investigations (**carve outs**), and centralized billet systems. 

Two types of SAP exist - achknowledged and unacknowledged. The existence of an acknowledged SAP may be publicly disclosed, but the details of the program remain classified. An **unacknowledged SAP** (or **USAP**) is made known only to authorized persons, includeing members of the appropriate committees of the United States Congress. **Waived SAPs** are a subset of unacknowledged SAPs in the Department of Defense (DoD). These SAPs are exempt by statutory authority of the Secretary of Defense from most reporting requirements and, within the legislative branch, the only persons who are required to be informed of said SAPs are the chairpersons and ranking committee emmbers of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, House Appropriations Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. Oftentimes, this notification is only oral.
