  Background: Special Access Programs (SAPs)
  <a href="#background-special-access-programs-saps" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Special Access Programs</strong> (<strong>SAPs</strong>) in the U.S. Federal Government are security protocols that provide highly classified information with safeguards and access restrictions that exceed those for regular (collateral) classified information. SAPs can range from <strong>black projects</strong> to routine but especially-sensitive operations, such as COMSEC (communications security) maintenance or presidential transportation support. In addition to collateral controls, a SAP may impose more stringent investigative or adjudicative requirements, specialized non-disclosure agreements, special terminology or markings, exclusion from standard contract investigations (<strong>carve outs</strong>), and centralized billet systems.</p>
<p>Two types of SAP exist - achknowledged and unacknowledged. The existence of an acknowledged SAP may be publicly disclosed, but the details of the program remain classified. An <strong>unacknowledged SAP</strong> (or <strong>USAP</strong>) is made known only to authorized persons, includeing members of the appropriate committees of the United States Congress. <strong>Waived SAPs</strong> are a subset of unacknowledged SAPs in the Department of Defense (DoD). These SAPs are exempt by statutory authority of the Secretary of Defense from most reporting requirements and, within the legislative branch, the only persons who are required to be informed of said SAPs are the chairpersons and ranking committee emmbers of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, House Appropriations Committee, and the House Armed Services Committee. Oftentimes, this notification is only oral.</p>

  Davis-Wilson Memo: Executive Summary
  <a href="#davis-wilson-memo-executive-summary" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In October 2002, physicist Eric Davis had a lengthy conversation with retired Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson, in a meeting arranged by Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO) Las Vegas chapter president Richard Cohn. Davis had been looking into getting information about a crash retrieval program and had gotten a letter from Will Miller in April 2002 that offered some leads. Wilson had decided to speak to Eric Davis after talking to Oke Shannon in 1999, as well as Rich and Doug from AFIO, who all vouched for him. Davis was someone who wouldnt betray Wilsons trust, which was very important to Wilson as Miller had talked to a journalist about a private meeting in the Pentagon with Wilson, which got published in 2000.</p>
<p>Wilson told Davis about this Pentagon meeting that happened in April 1997 where he, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director General Patrick Hughes, and an admiral had met with a group consisting of Steven Greer, Will Miller, and Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell to talk about UFOs, crash/retrieved craft, etc. Miller and Wilson talked a couple hours after the group meeting. Wilson would spend the next several weeks looking for such a secret program.</p>
<p>Wilson made calls and talked to people, getting information on where to search. Speaking with people such as former Secretary of Defense William Perry, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology (USDAT) Paul Kaminski, as well as several Air Force generals he got tips to go through the records group files at OUSDAT. Wilson made several calls with those people to verify he had the right contractor and program manager to talk to and they confirmed it. He had also talked to several program managers who either said they werent the program he was looking for or referred him to that same one.</p>
<p>Wilson contacted the program manager and was on a conference call along with the security director and corporate attorney. He explained that he wanted to know about their crashed UFO program and what their role was. They were surprised and agitated by Wilsons call, and wanted to know who Wilson had talked to before he reached them. Wilson told them he wanted a formal briefing, tour, etc. and was exploiting his regulatory authority as Deputy Director DIA to provide the necessary oversight.</p>
<p>A face-to-face meeting was arranged at their facility. Wilson flew out and met the three in a secured conference room, at a top aerospace defense contractor. &ldquo;The watch committee&rdquo;, or gate keepers as they called themselves, consisted of the security director (a NSA-retired counter-intelligence expert), program director, and corporate attorney. They explained how their cover was nearly blown previously over an audit investigation and that money and keeping the program hidden were paramount issues. A formal agreement was struck with people at the Pentagon to prevent such circumstances happening again, where there would be rigorous access criteria set by the contractor committee, regardless of government personnel position or clearance. When Wilson asked what the criteria was, these three refused to answer. The meeting&rsquo;s purpose was to tell Wilson they were worried about exposure and wanted an accounting of his conversations at the Pentagon and elsewhere. After much argument, they pulled out their list of individuals read into the program which was dated 1990, updated 1993, and consisted of 400-800 names. This list had no politicians or staffers in the White House or Congress, and only a handful of Pentagon individuals Wilson recognized - it was primarily civilian program employees: engineers, scientists, managers, etc. The program manager said it was a reverse engineering program of an intact craft they believed could fly (space? air? water? dimensions?), that they didn&rsquo;t know where it was from but the technology was <em>not of this Earth - not made by man - not made by human hands.</em> The lack of outside expert community collaborations made progress very slow. Wilson was still angry for being denied access and threatened he would go to hte Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC) to gain access.</p>
<p>In June 1997, a subgroup of SAPOC members called the Senior Review Group (SRG) met with Wilson at the Pentagon and ultimately agreed they would sustain the contractor - Wilson would not be granted access. Wilson was very angry and told by the SRG chairman that he was to immediately drop the issue or he would not be promoted to Director of DIA, get early retirement, and lose 1 or 2 stars along the way.</p>
<p>In January 1998, Jacques Gansler (the new USDAT) and Wilson talked and Gansler had been briefed on the matter and told Wilson UFOs are real, so - called alien abductions not real and that Wilson should not discuss it further. Wilson served as Director of DIA from July 1999 to July 2002. Wilson was in Nevada to wrap up some projects he had begun in 1998 and used the opportunity to meet with Davis. Davis said hed use the notes for personal research, to track down the story, and ascertain signal/noise in media and from government sources. He asked Wilson about whether he would talk to some of his colleagues like Hal Puthoff and Kit Green, but Wilson said hed prefer not to talk to anyone else about it again as it would risk exposure.</p>

<ul>
<li>Greer, Miller, and Mitchell gave talk in Pentagon Conference room with Adm. Tom Wilson, Adm. Mike Cramer (typo in Davis-Wilson Memo as Crawform), <strong>Gen. Pat Hughes</strong>; others present. Miller and Wilson talked privately afterward for 2 hours on topics including crashed UFOs. Wilson is intrigued about claims and decides to search if such a program exists.</li>

<p><strong>circa mid April 1997</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson starts making calls, knocking
on a few doors, talked to people –
went on about 45 days on and off.
<strong>Gen H. Marshal Ward</strong> said to go
through the records group files (like
an index system) in Office of Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Technology (OUSDAT).
May 1997</li>
<li>Former Secretary of Defense <strong>William J Perry</strong>, who reorganized special
programs in 1994, suggested same
thing as Ward. Wilson talked to <strong>Paul Kaminski</strong> (USDAT) and <strong>Michael Kostelnik</strong> (former Director of Special

</h3>
<p><strong>End of May 1997</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson made several calls to Kaminski, Kostelnik, and Perry who confirmed he had the right contractor and program manager to talk to. Wilson made three calls to the program manager – one with conference call with security director and corporate attorney, who were agitated and surprised by the call. Four program managers had referred Wilson to that trio, and three programs said they weren’t what/who Wilson was looking for. Wilson said he wanted formal briefing, tour, etc. per his regulatory and statutory authority of his position.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2 days later</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The watch committee</em> of the program director, security director (counterintelligence expert that was retired from National Security Agency), and corporate attorney called Wilson and said they would do a face-to-face meeting at their facility. Wilson would go 10 days later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>circa mid June 1997</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson flew out there and met the three in their conference room in their secure vault. They explain their program is a reverse engineering program involving technological hardware recovered that their program manager said was not of this Earth. These gatekeepers said they made an agreement with some in the Pentagon Senior Executive Service to set the criteria for who has a need-to-know after an earlier incident with an audit investigation nearly blew the lid off them. They showed their bigot list, the personnel possessing appropriate security clearance and who are cleared to know details of the sensitive information, which had 400-800 names, mostly civilian program employees but no politicians. Wilson was being denied access by them and he said he would take it up with the Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>circa near end of June 1997</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson called SAPOC subgroup members (Senior Review Group) to Pentagon meeting and told them what happened. 2 days later and met again with Senior Review group (before last week of June) and they said they were sustaining the contractor and Wilson to immediately drop the matter and let it go.</li>

<p><strong>circa near late June 1997</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson told Miller that Miller was right and such an organization (MJ-12/UFO cabal) existed. Wilson says he told Miller what he did in Pentagon Records Group search but no more. Wilson told Miller Senior Review Group chairman (purported to be Deputy USDAT Noel Longuemare, Jr.) said if Wilson didn’t drop it he wouldn’t see Director DIA promotion, get early retirement, lose 1 or 2 stars along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>September 1997</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson begins as Associate Director of Central Intelligence for Military Support at CIA.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>January 1998</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson talked to the Kaminski’s successor, Jacques Gansler about June 1997 meetings. Gansler said he had been briefed about it and that “UFOs are real, so-called ‘alien abductions’ not real,” then told Wilson to drop the matter – no more discussion about it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>March 1998</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson is assigned as Director for Intelligence (J-2), a DIA billet operationally allocated to the Joint Staff.</li>

<p><strong>circa August 1999</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilson calls Oke Shannon in 2 hour phone conversation, with Wilson asking if he can trust Dr. Eric Davis and a few others. Shannon said Davis was honorable and wanted Wilson to talk to Davis about what he told Miller (ca. April 1997 and June 1997), saying that Davis was a team player and would stay quiet, obeying all restrictions. Wilson said he was too busy at the time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>May 21, 2000</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boston Globe publishes story by <strong>Leslie Kean</strong> describing Miller’s April 1997 meetings in Washington. The following month this is published in the French magazine VSD and mentions “Miller, Lovekin, Mitchell and Greer brought the same information to the Joint Staff Vice Director for Intelligence at a private Pentagon briefing.” Wilson is furious at Miller for violating personal and professional trust, as both Navy and intelligence colleagues. Wilson got calls from all over and was butt of sarcastic, stupid jokes.</li>

<p>Primary quotes from interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s all fiction. I wouldn’t know Eric Davis if he walked in right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying that sometime, somewhere, I never met (Davis), but I certainly don’t know him, I don’t remember him, and I definitely did not sit with him in a car for an hour in Las Vegas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You may also see in those notes where I came with two other naval officers, a lieutenant and a lieutenant commander, and a petty officer who was driving the car. I was not even in the Navy then. And the Navy was certainly not ferrying me around in a car at that point. Those notes are really detailed – it’s like somebody wrote a fiction piece. But it never happened, trust me. There are so many things in those notes that are demonstrably inaccurate. And I don’t know how I could prove it, but I haven’t been to Las Vegas since 1979, 80.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the synopsis of the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding a meeting referenced in the notes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t remember the details, but they [Mitchell was accompanied by UFO researcher Steven Greer] said there would be evidence in black programs, and would I be interested in chasing it down. I told them I had far too many things to do. I’m not saying there are no such programs because I don’t know. I didn’t check or follow up. It might not have been a waste of time for somebody (to pursue), but I did not have time to waste, believe me. At the time I was up to my eyeballs in Bosnia and Kosovo and Korea and Iraq and, you name it, terrorism. So I didn’t feel I should spend my time — well, I had enough black programs I had to deal with.</p>

<p>The entire memo attributed to Dr. Davis, including his characterization of my attitude, emotions and sentiments about other individuals is pure fiction.” “Many of the people (Oke Shannon, Mike Crawford, Linda, Rich, Doug) he characterizes in the memo as people I interacted with are completely unknown to me, as are the conversations I purportedly had on Special Access Programs related to UFOs with senior officials in the Department of Defence &hellip;</p>
